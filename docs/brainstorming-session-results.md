## Technique Sessions

### Session 1: First Principles Thinking - Foundation Building

**Description:** Breaking down the core problem to fundamental components to build up comprehensive solutions

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Core Problem**: ISP misleading advertising - "unlimited" is actually 1TB cap
2. **Family Usage Challenge**: 8-10 people sharing 1TB can quickly exhaust data
3. **High-Speed Consumption Risk**: 80-90 Mbps allows rapid data consumption through large downloads
4. **Manual Monitoring Pain**: Constantly logging into 192.168.88.1 is tedious and reactive
5. **Need for Proactive Management**: Want alerts and automation instead of reactive checking
6. **Financial Protection**: KES 2500 investment needs protection through smart usage management
7. **Analytics Requirements**: Daily spending rates, carryover calculations, trend analysis
8. **Historical Data Need**: Full month storage for pattern analysis and planning

**Key Insights From This Analysis:**
- This is fundamentally a **family resource management** problem, not just monitoring
- **Proactive vs Reactive** approach is critical
- **Financial impact** makes this high-stakes (KES 2500 monthly)

**Continuing with deeper data requirements:**

9. **Current Remaining Balance**: Real-time data on what's left in the 1TB allocation
10. **Usage Velocity Tracking**: How fast the family is consuming data (MB/hour, GB/day)
11. **Daily Budget Calculator**: Automatic calculation of "safe" daily usage to last the month
12. **Overage/Underage Tracking**: Am I ahead or behind the planned daily consumption?
13. **Smart Download Timing**: Intelligence on when it's "safe" to download large files
14. **Enhanced Analytics Engine**: Since Taara only shows remaining amount, need bot to create detailed breakdowns and projections
15. **Flexible Planning**: Ability to remember and add new requirements as they emerge

**Key Insight**: Need to transform Taara's basic "remaining balance" into **actionable intelligence**

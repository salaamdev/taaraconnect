# Gate Decision Summary
gate_summary: |
  CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE REQUIRED: This story has exceptional business requirements but lacks the 
  technical architecture foundation necessary for safe development. Risk assessment identified 3 
  critical risks (score 9) and 4 high risks that must be resolved before development can proceed.
  
  Key strengths: Comprehensive requirements, clear business value, thoughtful UX design
  Critical blockers: API resilience (score 9), resource management (score 9), security architecture (score 9)
  
  STATUS: Architecture phase required (estimated 1-2 weeks) before sprint planning can begin.

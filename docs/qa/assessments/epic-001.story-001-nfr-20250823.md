# NFR Assessment: epic-001.story-001

Date: 2025-08-23
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Missing credential rotation, no rate limiting specified
- Performance: CONCERNS - Aggressive polling may stress budget hosting  
- Reliability: CONCERNS - 99% target unrealistic, limited fallback mechanisms
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Missing testing strategy and database schema

## Critical Issues

1. **Missing credential rotation strategy** (Security)
   - Risk: Stored ISP credentials vulnerable to compromise over time
   - Fix: Implement secure credential refresh and rotation mechanism

2. **No API rate limiting protection** (Security)
   - Risk: Potential abuse of ISP API endpoints
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware before production

3. **Aggressive 10-minute polling** (Performance)
   - Risk: May overwhelm budget hosting resources and ISP API
   - Fix: Implement adaptive polling with exponential backoff

4. **Unrealistic 99% polling reliability** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Setting unattainable SLA expectations
   - Fix: Design realistic targets with graceful degradation

5. **Missing database design** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Inefficient storage of 12 months historical data
   - Fix: Define schema with archival and retention strategy

6. **No testing strategy for ISP integration** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Difficult to test API integration without mocking
   - Fix: Define API mocking and integration test approach

## NFR Requirements Found in Story

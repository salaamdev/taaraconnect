3. Adjust tomorrow's plans if needed

### Before Heavy Usage

Before downloading large files or streaming videos:

1. **Check your current balance** - ensure you have enough data
2. **Look at days remaining** - make sure you won't run out too early
3. **Check your daily rate** - see if you can afford the extra usage
4. **Consider timing** - maybe wait until closer to renewal if balance is low

### Weekly Planning

Once a week, review:
- Your usage trends from the charts
- Whether you're using data faster or slower than expected
- Plan any large downloads for when you have plenty of data

## Understanding the Data

### Data Measurements

**Gigabytes (GB)** - The main unit used
- 1 GB = 1,000 MB (megabytes)
- Typical usage examples:
  - Web browsing: 0.1-0.2 GB per hour
  - Video calls: 0.5-1 GB per hour
  - HD video streaming: 3 GB per hour
  - Large game download: 20-100 GB

### Reading Your Balance

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1**: Good Situation ✅
- Current Balance: 800 GB
- Days Remaining: 25
- Daily Rate: 2 GB
- **Analysis**: You're using 2 GB per day with 25 days left = 50 GB total needed. You have 800 GB, so you're in great shape!

**Scenario 2**: Need to Be Careful ⚠️
- Current Balance: 100 GB
- Days Remaining: 20
- Daily Rate: 8 GB
- **Analysis**: You're using 8 GB per day with 20 days left = 160 GB needed. You only have 100 GB, so you need to reduce usage.

**Scenario 3**: Critical Situation 🚨
- Current Balance: 50 GB
- Days Remaining: 15
- Daily Rate: 10 GB
- **Analysis**: You're using 10 GB per day with 15 days left = 150 GB needed. You only have 50 GB - you'll run out in 5 days!

### Chart Interpretation

**Balance Over Time Chart:**
- Should show a gradual decline (normal usage)
- Steep drops indicate heavy usage days
- Flat lines indicate no/minimal usage

**Daily Usage Chart:**
- Shows your consumption patterns
- Helps identify which days you use more data
- Useful for planning heavy usage activities
